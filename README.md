      particle collision simulator

## what's this?

- RayLib
- Elastic collision | momentum & K.E conservation

The collision checking currently has O(n^2) time-complexity, this can be made better using\
algorithms like: Sweep and Prune, Uniform Grid Space Partitioning.

The algorithm currently used is neighbours check(idk the actual name).

## is it GIF or GIF?
